Synopsis  : Interpolation from data defined on uniform Cartesian lattices to arbitrary spatial locations

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This directory defines classes that aid in the interpolation of quantities that are discretely given on a uniform Cartesian lattice, such that a value of the quantity being
represented can be computed at an arbitrary spatial location (generally within the boundaries of the lattice, otherwise extrapolation is employed). Consequently, classes
defined in this directory generally depend on Cartesian lattice definitions (PhysBAM_Tools/Grids_Uniform), storage arrays on uniform lattices (PhysBAM_Tools/Grids_Uniform_Arrays)
and non-grid-specific interpolation methods (PhysBAM_Tools/Interpolation).

Class INTERPOLATION_UNIFORM defines the common interface of interpolation classes on uniform lattices. Derived from it, class LINEAR_INTERPOLATION_UNIFORM defines a linear
(or multi-linear, in more than one dimensions) interpolation scheme, which is the most common scheme in PhysBAM. The linear interpolation functionality is aware of a GRID being
regular or a MAC lattice, and classes LINEAR_INTERPOLATION_MAC_nD_HELPER provide some of the functionality specific to interpolating from values on a MAC grid. 

Class FACE_LOOKUP_UNIFORM abstracts a lookup interface for the discrete values used in an interpolation operation. It admits a trivial implementation for uniform grids (which is
different from the case of collidable and multi-phase data).

The following files implement more specific functionality:

INTERPOLATION_UNIFORM_FORWARD.h:
    Forward declarations for uniform grid interpolation classes

AVERAGING_UNIFORM.h:
    Helpers for the special case of interpolation of quantities from and to different grid primitives (nodes, faces and cells)

LINEAR_INSIDE_CONSTANT_OUTSIDE_INTERPOLATION_UNIFORM.h:
    Augmentation of linear interpolation with constant extrapolation outside the boundaries of the lattice

CATMULL_ROM_SPLINE_INTERPOLATION.h:
    Interpolation using a Catmull-Rom spline from uniformly sampled data

CUBIC_MN_INTERPOLATION_UNIFORM.h:
