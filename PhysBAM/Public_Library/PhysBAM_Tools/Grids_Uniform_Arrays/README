Synopsis  : Storage classes for quantities sampled on uniform Cartesian lattices
##################################################

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This directory defines classes that store arrays of variables sampled on uniform Cartesian lattices, and are consequently closely related with the Cartesian lattice class
GRID defined in PhysBAM_Tools/Grids_Uniform.

Classes ARRAYS_nD (n=1,2,3, defined in the respective header ARRAYS_nD.h) implement n-dimensional arrays of variables on a rectangular lattice. On a regular GRID object
(that is, not one that represents a MAC grid), we can associate the nodes of the grid with the values stored in an ARRAYS_nD object with the same size and dimension. Class
ARRAYS_ND_BASE contains the common functionality to ARRAYS_nD types of all dimensions.

Classes FACE_ARRAYS_nD store variables sampled at the face centers of a uniform grid. Since an n-dimensional grid has faces oriented normal to n distinct axes, a
FACE_ARRAYS_nD object employs n ARRAYS_nD objects for its internal storage.

Headers

FLOOD_FILL_1D.h
FLOOD_FILL_2D.h
FLOOD_FILL_3D.h

provide convenient flood fill functionality over integer-valued ARRAY_nD objects. These utility classes are initialized with seed labels and can either perform an unconstrained
fill, or block propagation of seed regions across specified grid faces. 

Finally the following files

ARRAYS_UNIFORM_FORWARD.h
GRIDS_UNIFORM_ARRAYS_FORWARD.h
GRID_ARRAYS_POLICY_UNIFORM.h

provide forward declarations and policy type definitions.

TODO: Add explanations for ARRAYS_UTILITIES.{h,cpp} and FACE_ARRAYS_DYADIC_UNIFORM.h
