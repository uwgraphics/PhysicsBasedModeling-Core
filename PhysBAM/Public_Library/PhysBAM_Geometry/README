This Repository contains the geometry and related algorithms used by PhysBAM.  It should not depend on any other components of PhysBAM except PhysBAM_Tools.

Methods heavily duplicated between PhysBAM_Rendering and PhysBAM_OpenGL should be *considered* for candidacy here.  For example, tesselation (the generation of a triangulated surface from other
geometry) may well be considered a technique for rendering, but it is general enough to warrent placement in PhysBAM_Geometry.

From Ron:
  PhysBAM_Geometry will contain all of our geometry.  Obviously Triangulated surfaces, all the connectivity, solids particles, etc.
