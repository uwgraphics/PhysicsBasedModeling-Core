How to setup scons:

1. Install scons.
2. Run setup_symlinks to litter SConstruct/SConscript files throughout your tree.
3. Copy SConstruct.options into the toplevel physbam directory and adjust if desired.
   Specifically check the value of cache.
4. Here's my alias to run scons:
     alias cns='scons -Q --random --implicit-cache -u -j 32'
